Known Bugs
----------

You may have to press enter twice sometimes, it appears to be a bug with reading from standard input
and has nothing to do with the code. The problem seems to happen only sometimes, and only if run
in a specific environment (mingw compiler) but rarely in gcc in ubuntu.

Extra Features
--------------

(if your program has any extra or special features, tell us about them here)

Wildcard match

- '*' matches any sequence of chars, inculing empty string.
- '?' matches any one char.
- '\?', '\*' can escape them.
- '\\' would be '\'
